# who_are_you
An R Shiny app showing the end user's information

I'm making this to test out user session information - to see if it is available when hosting via Rstudio's shinyapps.io. My initial conclusion is *no*, hosting via shinyapps.io does *not* allow for end-user's crednetials to be read.

According to their [documentation](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/permissions.html), it looks like this feature is only valid when hosted via Rstudio Connect or Shiny Serever Pro.

As seen on web my local computer:

But as seen on the web version hosted via shinyapps.io:
